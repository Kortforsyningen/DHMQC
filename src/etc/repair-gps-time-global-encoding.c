0. SYNOPSIS

    repair-gps-time-global-encoding LAS_FILE...

Repair global encoding field of one or more .las files by binarey
patching.

WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS UTILITY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO!!! [2]

--

1. BACKGROUND

In a .las file header, bit 0 of the GLOBAL ENCODING field identifies
how the time stamps in the file are to be interpreted.

There are two varieties:

Flag == 0.
    Time stamps are to be interpreted as GPS week time, i.e. seconds
    since the start of the GPS-week of the observation campaign
    (which must be known from external sources - it is not stored in
    the las file)

Flag == 1.
    Time stamps are to be interpreted as "Adjusted GPS time",
    i.e. seconds since the epoch of the GPS time frame, adjusted by
    subtracting 1 000 000 000 seconds (1e9).
 
See [1] for details.

--

2. PROBLEM

It sometimes happen that a file with time stamps in Adjusted GPS
time is stored with an encoding flag indicating GPS week time.

--

3. SOLUTION

This horribly obnoxious little utility repairs that problem by
pure and dumb binary patching.
