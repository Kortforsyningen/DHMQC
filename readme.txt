Build instructions... 

- change directory to src/build
- from the shell run "python deploy.py"
- use -x64 to specify 64-bit build (your compiler will already do that, this will only change a few defines)
- use -msvc to build with Visual Studio command line tools. Run from a Visual Studio command shell. Default compiler is some sort of gcc.

look at the example "test.py" in the folder "scripts" for some basic commands.
